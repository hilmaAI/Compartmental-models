## 1. EPIDEMIC CYCLES IN AN SIR MODEL

### a. Define epidemic cycles in a SIR model with births and deaths: describe the model in words, including key assumptions.

The SIR model with births and deaths is a modified version of the standard SIR model that accounts for population changes over time due to births and natural deaths. It is divided into three compartments: Susceptible (S), which refers to individuals who are healthy and can contract the disease. New individuals enter this compartment through births. Then, Infected (I), which refers to individuals who have contracted the disease and can transmit it to others. These individuals may die due to the disease or recover. Finally, Recovered (R) refers to individuals who have recovered from the disease and are immune to reinfection. They exit the population through natural deaths.

In this model, epidemic cycles can emerge because of the interplay between the replenishment of susceptibles through births and the depletion of susceptibles through infection. When the number of susceptible individuals is high, the disease spreads rapidly, increasing the number of infected individuals. As more people become infected and subsequently recover, the number of susceptible individuals decreases, causing the infection to slow down and eventually recede. However, with births continuously adding new susceptibles to the population, the susceptible pool eventually becomes large enough for another epidemic outbreak to occur.

Assupmptions:

•	Each individual has an equal chance of contacting any other individual.
•	New individuals are born into the susceptible class at a constant rate (μ).
•	Individuals in all compartments (S, I, R) die at the same constant rate (μ).
•	Susceptibles become infected at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals (β).
•	Infected individuals recover and gain immunity at a constant rate.
•	Death is only due to natural causes, not the disease itself.
•	Population changes occur only due to births and natural deaths; no migration occurs.

### b. Draw a model diagram of your SIR model with births and deaths.

### e. Describe what is happening to the number of new infections for each of these cases:

* R~n~ > 1: The number of new infections is increasing, indicating the disease is spreading rapidly.
* R~n~ < 1: The number of new infections is decreasing, meaning the epidemic is subsiding as fewer people are being infected.
* R~n~ at peak: The number of new infections is at its maximum, and the epidemic is transitioning from growth to decline, with each infected person infecting exactly one other person on average.

### f. When the number of new infections is less than the number of births, the proportion susceptibles is ____________. When the number of new infections is more than the number of births, the proportion of susceptibles is ________________.

When the number of new infections is less than the number of births, the proportion of susceptibles is increasing. When the number of new infections is more than the number of births, the proportion of susceptibles is decreasing.

## 2. SEIR MODEL

### a. Define the SEIR model (no births or deaths): describe the model in words, including key assumptions.

The SEIR model is a modified version of the SIR model that includes an additional compartment to account for the latent period of a disease. It is divided into four compartments: Susceptible (S) refers to individuals who are healthy and can contract the disease. These individuals move to the exposed compartment when they come into contact with an infected individual. Exposed (E) refers to individuals who have been infected but are not yet infectious. This compartment represents the latent period, where individuals have the disease but cannot yet transmit it to others. After the latent period, they move to the infected compartment. Infected (I) refers to individuals who have contracted the disease and can transmit it to others. After a period of being infectious, individuals recover and move to the recovered compartment. Recovered (R) refers to individuals who have recovered from the disease and gained immunity, meaning they are no longer susceptible to reinfection. In this model, the introduction of the exposed (E) compartment accounts for the incubation period, during which individuals are infected but not yet infectious. This latency causes a delay between the initial exposure of susceptible individuals to the disease and their ability to spread it to others. As susceptible individuals become exposed and then infected, the number of susceptible individuals decreases. Eventually, the number of infected individuals falls as more people recover and gain immunity. Since this model excludes births and deaths, the total population remains constant, and the epidemic eventually slows down and recedes as the susceptible population decreases.

Assumptions:
•	Each individual has an equal chance of contacting any other individual.
•	There are no births or deaths, so the population size remains constant.
•	After exposure, individuals spend a latent period in the exposed compartment before becoming infectious, moving from E to I at a constant rate (σ).
•	Susceptible individuals become exposed at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals (β).
•	Infected individuals recover and gain immunity at a constant rate (γ).
•	Recovered individuals are immune and cannot be reinfected.

### b. Draw a model diagram of your SEIR model (without births and deaths).

### e. What is the rate of becoming infectious (from pre-infectious)?

From the parameters provided:

Pre-infectious period = 8 days

1/Pre-infectious period = 1/8 = 0.125 per day


### f. What is the recovery rate?

Duration of infection = 7 days

1/Duration of infection = 1/7 ~ 0.143 per day

### g. How would you calculate lambda?

In SEIR models, 𝜆represents the force of infection, which is the rate at which susceptible individuals become exposed to the disease. It depends on the transmission rate β and the number of infected individuals.

λ = β⋅ I/N

β is the transmission rate (which can be calculated from R0 as β = R0⋅γ,
I is the number of infectious individuals at a given time,
N is the total population size (S + E + I + R)

### h. Why would you include births and deaths in this model?

Including births and deaths in the SEIR model would make the model more realistic for long-term simulations of an infectious disease in a population. In real populations, individuals are continuously being born and dying, which affects the number of susceptibles (through births) and the overall population size (through natural deaths). Births add new susceptibles to the population, which can trigger new cycles of infection in endemic diseases. Deaths (whether from natural causes or disease-induced) affect the number of individuals in each compartment and thus impact the spread and control of the disease.

### i. Under what conditions (i.e., what combinations of contact rate, rho, and duration of disease) would R~0~ < 1?

The basic reproduction number 𝑅0 is the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual in a fully susceptible population. 

R0 = β.1/γ

β = contact rate x ρ(transmission rate per contact),
γ is the recovery rate (the inverse of the duration of infection).

For R0 < 1, the following condition must hold:β⋅1/γ <1

This implies that the transmission rate β must be sufficiently low compared to the recovery rate γ. In terms of contact rate,ρ, and duration of disease, R0 < 1 occurs when:

The contact rate is low (fewer interactions between individuals),

The transmission probability per contact (ρ) is low (lower chance of infection upon contact),

The duration of infection is short (individuals recover quickly, reducing the window for transmission).


Mathematically, this can be achieved by having either a low contact rate, a low transmission probability, or a short duration of infection, such that the product 𝛽= contact rate ×𝜌is smaller than the recovery rate γ.

## 3. SIRS MODEL (WANING IMMUNITY)

### d. Plot the number of incident infections over time.
